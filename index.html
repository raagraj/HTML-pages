        <h1>Flowers</h1>
        <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, 
        is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
        (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). 
        The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, 
        usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. 
        Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from 
        different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination 
        or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) 
        when self-pollination occurs.</p>

        <p>The flower has two essential parts: the vegetative part, 
        consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, 
        and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower 
        consists of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a 
        short stalk. Each of these kinds of parts is arranged in a whorl 
        on the receptacle.</p>
